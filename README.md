**UPDATING**  
If you need to update this program, make sure to backup your options.ini, that's where your API keys are stored. It's safe to delete/replace everything else.

--------Version 0.8--------  
-Changed: Installation path changed for base folder, not bin64.  
-Fixed: Fixed a crash if installation folder was wrong.  
-Fixed: Don't clear installation path if selection is cancelled.  
-Fixed: Enabled auto-scale for high DPI scaling.  
-New: Added code to check for new updates (althought you need to download it manually).  
-New: Added buttons to launch and close the game (maploadinfo by default).  
-New: Added info for Legendary insights and Legendary divinations (this takes ages to load because it must scan all your characters inventories, bank, materials, etc).  
-New: Added themes to customize the colors of the program (this took 8 hours and nobody requested it but I got bored of how the program was looking so this one is on me! xD).  
-New: Added checkboxes to customize which sections to load and which ones not.  
-New: Added preparations to support different languages (not ready yet).
